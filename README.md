# Crop Yield Prediction Using ML algorithm Takagi-Sugeno-Kang Mini-Batch Gradient Descent (TSK-MBGD)
In this case study, you will undertake the complete data analysis process to examine a dataset focused on crop yield prediction in the context of global food security. Throughout this journey, you'll discover innovative methods for data manipulation using advanced machine learning techniques, particularly the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) Fuzzy Model combined with Mini-batch Gradient Descent (MBGD).

We will delve into this agricultural dataset, which includes comprehensive environmental and management factors collected from 2016-2018, comprising 1,582 samples across 360 features. Let's examine its attributes more closely and formulate some questions to guide our analysis:

Through this analysis, we aim to address the crucial challenge of food security by developing more accurate crop yield predictions, ultimately supporting better agricultural practices and strategic decision-making for farmers and policymakers.

**Answering these Questions**

Q1: How can we leverage the TSK Fuzzy Model to capture complex, nonlinear relationships between environmental factors and crop yields?

Q2: What insights can we gain from analyzing the interplay between different agricultural variables?

Q3: How does our implementation of MBGD improve computational efficiency while maintaining prediction accuracy?

Q4: What role do various environmental and management factors play in determining crop yields?
